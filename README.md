# AuthCoreApi
 AuthCoreApi is a robust .NET Core API designed with a Code-First DB approach, integrating comprehensive role-based authorization and access controls to ensure secure data management

 # .Net Core Web API 
1. Code First Approach
2. Dependency Injection
3. Authentication
4. Role Based Authorization
5. Role Based Access

 # Create Models

# Nugget Packages
We are following code first approach that need entity framework core  that is needed for our application. And we have domain model that is basically derive the structure of database . We will tells Entity framework that is our database models and entity framework will create database for us. For that purpose we need to ist install entity framework packages

# DbContext Class
Maintaining connection to Db
Track Changes
Perform CRUD Operation
Bridge between domain models and the database.
Define the way of database schema using entity classes or domain classes Which maps directly to table in Database.

# Dependency Injection 
Design pattern to increase maintainability , testability.
DI built into Asp.net core
DI is responsible for creating and managing instances.
DI works on this fundamental that instead of instantiating object within a class those objects are passed in as parameters to the class , like passing it to constructer or method.
.NET core provides built in container that can be used to manage the dependencies of an application.
The container is responsible for creating and managing of services which are registered with the container when the application start

1. Add services to the container. 
2. Pass the connection string  to ApplicationDbContext

# Running EF Core Migrations
In visual Studio Open the NuGet Package Manager Console
For creating DB and schema type  PM> Add-Migration "Initial Migrationâ€œ 
It is creating a script that EF core can use to create a latter on a SQL script and then create a DB.

# PM> Add-Migration InitialCreate -Context ApplicationDbContext
# PM> update-database -context ApplicationDbContext
